# MS1's Mini-Bank 💵

```
A clean little command-line banking app built in Python. 
It’s simple, structured, and works like a tiny ATM; deposit money, 
make withdrawals, check your balance, calculate interest, 
and save your transaction history to a file.

You’ll get some smooth terminal output *and* a crispy `.txt` statement when you're done!
